            <h2>How QR Codes Work</h2>
            <p>QR codes store data using patterns of black dots and squares arranged on a grid. This data can be read by scanning the code with a QR code reader, typically a smartphone. The code can store various types of information, such as URLs, text, or other data.</p>

            <h2>Why QR Codes Were Created</h2>
            <p>The primary reason for creating QR codes was to enhance the capability of barcode technology. QR codes can store more data and can be scanned quickly from any direction, making them highly efficient for tracking and information retrieval.</p>
